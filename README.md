This repository is the backup of my major configurations. I added a deployment
script in order to facilitate the process on my computers but feel free to
send me your personal adjustments.

## Deployment

Those are guidelines to install my Jogsoul, Tmux, Vim and ZSH configurations
but you probably want to modify several steps.

```
git clone https://github.com/aseure/configs
mv configs .configs
cd .configs
./deploy.sh
```

Then, follow the instructions and don't forget to `source` your newly created
`.zshrc` file.
